Portfolio Project
The history of the real estate market can be described as cyclical and sometimes volatile. Research performed for this project will attempt to evaluate recent trends in the housing market in order to make an informed prediction about housing prices in the upcoming months. Knowledge gained for this project can help to better understand the potential for upcoming changes in the market providing the necessary information for critical decisions to be made. 
In order to properly analyze this data, SAS Studio will be the primary tool used to evaluate the data. Using SAS Studio allows for the data to be summarized and evaluated in multiple methods including, but not limited to, graphs, histograms, and time series forecasting. Once the data is properly analyzed, Tableau is utilized to create simple but meaningful visualizations that will allow for a dashboard to be created. The dashboard is interactive allowing for its user to explore the information in multiple ways.
